We've been friends for years and I've created\r\n                    music for several of his productions, so when I realized he\r\n                    didn't currently have a website I just had to put something\r\n                    great together for this awesome human.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <StaticImage\r\n                    layout=\"constrained\"\r\n                    width=\"600\"\r\n                    alt=\"A mockup with three different sections. Below is a caption that says 'IDEA: different designs for different services?' One design is for puppeteering and has squiggly bright 1990s shapes and a goofy soft puppet with eyes made from ping-pong balls; one is for puppet-making and is decorated with splatters of goo over a background of fake fur with a big picture of a ratty disheveled cat puppet in a priest costume from the movie The Exorcist; one is for haunted houses and has pictures of cobweb-covered skeletons and evil clowns in a dilapidated stone and wood mansion\"\r\n                    src=\"https://github.com/maxwellsquared/minimal-portfolio/blob/main/img/bjb2.jpg?raw=true\"\r\n                />\r\n                <p>\r\n                    This project is still early in the design stages (Halloween\r\n                    is his busiest time of year!) but I wanted to share some of\r\n                    the early work we've been putting together as this is one of\r\n                    the most fun projects I've ever tackled. In the center of\r\n                    the mockup above, you can see a still from Brendan's puppet\r\n                    version of <i>The Exorcist</i>. You can also get an idea of\r\n                    the way I like to design: providing the client with quick\r\n                    mockups to get a better idea of what they're looking for,\r\n                    then refining once I know I'm on the right track.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </section>\r\n            <section>\r\n                <h3>\r\n                    <a href=\"https://www.reportex.ca\">Reportex</a>\r\n                </h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    <i>\r\n                        Reportex was a full-service legal services firm focusing\r\n                        on court reporting.
