Dealing\r\n                    with the mouse was surprisingly tricky. The way I'd set up\r\n                    controls with the joystick left the player ship constantly\r\n                    trying to return to the center of the screen when the mouse\r\n                    stopped moving. After rewriting the move function to get\r\n                    around this, I realized that the way I was checking the\r\n                    position of the mouse was being interfered with by the\r\n                    render texture I was using to downsample my image to\r\n                    320x180, so this build of the game disables the low-res\r\n                    effect.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I'm not sure which I prefer. Learning to use render textures\r\n                    was a fun challenge, but I feel a little like when I was 12\r\n                    and thought the more Photoshop filters I used, the more\r\n                    Graphic Design I was doing. Maybe the game should stand on\r\n                    its own without the low-res effect.

These things are\r\n                    snackable, usually with simple graphics (Vampire Survivors,\r\n                    probably the biggest example of the genre, started with art\r\n                    from an asset pack) and satisfying mechanics that offer some\r\n                    kind of persistent upgrades as incentive to complete\r\n                    bite-sized runs. If triple-A games are bloated early-70s\r\n                    prog rock albums, these games are the first Ramones album:\r\n                    29 minutes long, recorded in a week for $6400, and nothing\r\n                    but bangers. Like that Ramones album, the best part is that\r\n                    it makes you think, “Hey, I could do this,” so I did.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <StaticImage\r\n                    layout=\"constrained\"\r\n                    width=\"600\"\r\n                    alt=\"Video game where a ship flies around a planet and shoots glowing targets.\"\r\n                    src=\"https://github.com/maxwellsquared/minimal-portfolio/blob/main/img/Gameplay-2.png?raw=true\"\r\n                />\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Or, at least, I'm doing it. It's not done yet: I still have\r\n                    a lot of features to add, but you can fly a ship around and\r\n                    shoot things with mostly complete effects and controls and\r\n                    scoring.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>Here's my process so far.</p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Initial Planning</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I started by thinking about a simple gameplay loop I was\r\n                    reasonably sure I could accomplish in a few weeks while\r\n                    teaching myself some new programming concepts. I've been\r\n                    wanting to build a Survivors-like for a while; the mechanics\r\n                    are simple yet satisfying, and I can think of a ton of ways\r\n                    to tweak them slightly and end up with a whole new game. I\r\n                    decided that combining bullet-heaven-style upgrades with\r\n                    rail shooting à la Star Fox 64 would be something fun,\r\n                    original, and within my capabilities.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    So: Star Fox 64, but you go around the level in an endless\r\n                    loop until there are too many enemies and you die, and the\r\n                    more you upgrade your ship, the more enemies you can handle.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I find when building projects that my favourite approach is\r\n                    to start with a minimum viable product and then add features\r\n                    and functionality. Eventually, I settled on the following\r\n                    objectives for my MVP:\r\n                </p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>Have a rail system moving the camera along…</li>\r\n                    <li>\r\n                        …where the player can move horizontally and vertically\r\n                        while the gameplay plane moves through the level (think\r\n                        Star Fox 64)...\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li>And can fire bullets in a straight line…</li>\r\n                    <li>To kill bad guys.</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I know that I tend to get caught up having fun with details,\r\n                    and adding a bunch of cool weapons and upgraded stats was\r\n                    something that I'd absolutely get bogged down in. I'm\r\n                    looking forward to setting that up after the initial\r\n                    mechanics are rock-solid, but for now I'm keeping the\r\n                    roguelike stuff for later.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Gameplay Plane and Movement</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    My first task was to implement a gameplay plane that moved\r\n                    along on rails, with the player able to control horizontal\r\n                    and vertical movement of their ship.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    One of my first big design decisions was that I wanted the\r\n                    player to move in a loop through the level instead of having\r\n                    a linear track with a beginning and end. I liked the idea of\r\n                    the player's progress being measured in terms of time, not\r\n                    space--it would make playing the same levels over and over\r\n                    feel more natural, and it meant that I could design my\r\n                    levels without needing to keep tight integration with the\r\n                    rest of what I was doing.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    This did mean that I'd need to make sure that when the rail\r\n                    for my rail shooter made a turn, I'd have to keep the player\r\n                    and camera pointing the right way:\r\n                </p>\r\n                <StaticImage\r\n                    layout=\"constrained\"\r\n                    width=\"600\"\r\n                    alt=\"Game interface on a track with a camera and a rocket ship\"\r\n                    src=\"https://github.com/maxwellsquared/minimal-portfolio/blob/main/img/track-movement.png?raw=true\"\r\n                />\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I decided the easiest solution for this would be to put\r\n                    everything into a GameplayPlane object which I would send\r\n                    down a track. Inside the GameplayPlane would be the camera,\r\n                    player, and anything else I needed. I would use local values\r\n                    like transform.localPosition to move things relative to the\r\n                    mine cart everything was crammed into.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I also decided to use Cinemachine's dolly track and dolly\r\n                    cart to build my track--I found a Mix and Jam video where\r\n                    they used this setup and it looked like it would fit my\r\n                    needs nicely, so I stole the idea. The track system is very\r\n                    handy and let me easily set up a track around the terrain\r\n                    I'd quickly sculpted.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <StaticImage\r\n                    layout=\"constrained\"\r\n                    width=\"600\"\r\n                    alt=\"Unity interface showing a track and terrain\"\r\n                    src=\"https://github.com/maxwellsquared/minimal-portfolio/blob/main/img/track-movement-2.png?raw=true\"\r\n                />\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    It came paired with a dolly cart, and I put a reference to\r\n                    that cart in the GameplayPlane script. Once per frame (on\r\n                    Update()), the GameplayPlane object would move itself to\r\n                    wherever the dollyCart was and match the dollyCart's\r\n                    side-to-side rotation.

When the B button is first pushed, isBoosting is\r\n                    set to true, SetSpeed() is called with forwardSpeed * 2 as\r\n                    an argument, and a looping particle system called\r\n                    boostParticles starts playing.

When the B button\r\n                    goes up, isBoosting is set to false, speed returns to\r\n                    forwardSpeed, and the .Stop() method is called on\r\n                    boostParticles.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    To make it clear that the player was going really fast, I\r\n                    added a reference to the virtual camera I'd included in the\r\n                    GameplayPlane, and at the start of Update() set that virtual\r\n                    camera's m_Lens.FieldOfView to a variable which I increased\r\n                    over time (if not boosting, that variable decreases over\r\n                    time). The code for this is all still pretty messy, and one\r\n                    of the next things I do is going to be to break it into\r\n                    separate functions instead of just cramming Update() full of\r\n                    stuff.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    It wasn't enough, though, and I realized that the boost\r\n                    function needed camera shake. I had to use a coroutine to\r\n                    implement this in the script I put on my camera object:\r\n                </p>\r\n                <code>\r\n                    public IEnumerator Shake(float duration, float magnitude)\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    &#123;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}Vector3 originalPos = transform.localPosition;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}float elapsed = 0.0f;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}while (elapsed &lt; duration)\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}&#123;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}float x = Random.Range(-1f, 1f) * magnitude;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}float y = Random.Range(-1f, 1f) * magnitude;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}transform.localPosition = new Vector3(x, y,\r\n                    originalPos.z);\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}elapsed += Time.deltaTime;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}// before continuing to the next iteration of the\r\n                    while loop, wait for the next frame <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}yield return null;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}&#125;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    {\"\\u00A0\"}transform.localPosition = originalPos;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    &#125;\r\n                    <br />\r\n                </code>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Our Shake function is a coroutine--an ongoing thing that\r\n                    lets you pause and pick up where you left off, which makes\r\n                    running a bunch of things at the same time easier. This\r\n                    mostly means that calling it is a little weird: in the\r\n                    player object, instead of just calling\r\n                    cameraShake.Shake(duration, magnitude) I have to use\r\n                    StartCoroutine(cameraShake.Shake(duration, magnitude)), at\r\n                    the top it says IEnumerator, and I can put yield return null\r\n                    in my while loop to have Unity put a bookmark in what it's\r\n                    doing and pick it up on the next frame. The rest of the\r\n                    function just sets a variable to the original local position\r\n                    of the object and another one to an elapsed time of zero,\r\n                    then moves the camera's localPosition around slightly\r\n                    (amplified by the magnitude passed in) until the proper\r\n                    duration is hit, at which point it resets its local\r\n                    position.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    For this Shake coroutine, I shake the camera on the local x\r\n                    and y axes, but I decided to add a little camera knockback\r\n                    to make the player's shots feel bigger, so I copied the\r\n                    coroutine but only moved along the Z axis to simulate\r\n                    recoil. I then started this coroutine (with a smaller\r\n                    magnitude and shorter duration) every time the player object\r\n                    called Shoot().\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Both of these uses of camera shake make the game feel much\r\n                    more responsive to the player's inputs.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h2>Game Logic and MVC Pattern</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    At this point, the game was starting to get relatively\r\n                    complicated, and I had a lot of features yet to implement! I\r\n                    decided to attempt a model-view-controller pattern to stay\r\n                    organized. I would have a GameManager object to serve as a\r\n                    model, keeping the score and business logic of the game; a\r\n                    canvas which would display information to the player; and\r\n                    then the player object as a controller to take input and\r\n                    send information to the GameController.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The GameManager currently just keeps track of the player\r\n                    score, but will include lives, upgrades, elapsed level time,\r\n                    and other player progress information in future. It keeps a\r\n                    score variable and has an UpdateScore method which takes in\r\n                    an integer, adds that integer to the score, and updates a\r\n                    scoreText UI element with the score information.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    As the game gets more complicated, organizing functionality\r\n                    like this will really start to come in handy.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Player Death and Resurrection</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I'd made some cute terrain, but it was frustrating flying\r\n                    into it and seeing that it was as hollow as a store-brand\r\n                    chocolate bunny. I needed a function to crash the player's\r\n                    ship.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I started with another particle system to represent the\r\n                    explosion as the player's ship hit anything with the\r\n                    \"ground\" tag (particle systems are fun!). I made a simple\r\n                    additive blend material, which I also applied to my boost\r\n                    particle system.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Over in the player object, I made a PlayerDeath() function\r\n                    which sets some big red text in the middle of the screen to\r\n                    read “D E A D,” stops the boost particles, sets speed to\r\n                    zero, and plays the death particles. Of course, I had to add\r\n                    a big camera shake. I then invoked a PlayerRespawn()\r\n                    function I made that reversed everything, cleared the text,\r\n                    and reset the player position to right back on the track.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I quickly realized that with the way I'd set up my control\r\n                    functions, a dead player could still move, boost, and shoot,\r\n                    so I added an isAlive variable, set it to false on death,\r\n                    and required it to operate any of the controls.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    To add a little more pizzazz, I set useGravity to true on\r\n                    the player's rigidBody and gave them an upwards pop, which\r\n                    was unrealistic but funny.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Fun with Render Textures</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I'd always thought there was something cool about\r\n                    low-resolution games played on a CRT. I tried to get a bit\r\n                    of that analog-style funk into my visuals by throwing some\r\n                    dithering and noise onto a post-processing volume, then\r\n                    adding bloom and carefully calibrating emissive textures and\r\n                    the skybox to make sure that I was getting only the stuff I\r\n                    wanted to glow. I added a tiny bit of chromatic aberration\r\n                    and lens distortion to again mimic that feel, but it was\r\n                    still lacking.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The trick that got me what I was really looking for was\r\n                    projecting everything onto a render texture at 320 x 180\r\n                    resolution (the N64 commonly rendered games at 320x240, but\r\n                    320x180 fits a 16:9 aspect ratio and looks nice on 1080p and\r\n                    4k monitors) and turning off anti-aliasing to get nice sharp\r\n                    pixels.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The current build of the game has the low-res effect\r\n                    disabled as I realized the way I was getting the mouse\r\n                    position was sending the position of the mouse on the\r\n                    320x180 render texture, not the 1920x1080 screen, so the\r\n                    player's movement was drastically limited. I'll fix this in\r\n                    a future build and possibly add a toggle for the effect in\r\n                    an options menu, but for now you get a peek at the assets in\r\n                    unnaturally high resolution.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Sound and Music</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The most important thing to me about a game is how it feels\r\n                    moment-to-moment, and sound is a huge component of that. I\r\n                    knew I wanted blippy, lo-fi effects. I have some experience\r\n                    with synthesizers, and I found a new software synth called\r\n                    LabChirp which is optimized for sound effects instead of\r\n                    music. I combined saw, square, and sine waves and noise with\r\n                    a few different filters and envelopes to make a combination\r\n                    of bleeps, zaps, and explosions. To make them hit a little\r\n                    harder for ears used to modern sound design, I brought them\r\n                    into Audacity, added a bit of compression and EQ, and\r\n                    layered them with each other and with field recordings\r\n                    sourced from royalty-free community sources.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    When it came time to actually put the sounds in the game, I\r\n                    began with the enemy death sound and was puzzled as to why\r\n                    it wasn't working. I realized I'd chosen the trickiest\r\n                    situation as enemies delete their game object on death, so\r\n                    the audio source that started playing the death sound was\r\n                    immediately gone. I decided to attach the audio source to\r\n                    the enemy explosion particle system prefab, instead, which\r\n                    worked perfectly as the particle system deletes itself once\r\n                    it finishes playing (which is well after the sound\r\n                    finishes).\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Adding sounds to the player for death and shooting was much\r\n                    simpler, as the player object persists throughout the game,\r\n                    but I did add a feature that randomizes the volume of the\r\n                    shooting sound slightly to make it sound less repetitive.\r\n                    For the boost sound, I took a brief white noise sound with a\r\n                    natural fade-out and wrote a function to play it at a fixed\r\n                    interval while boosting, then played around with that\r\n                    interval until it sounded good.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    After spending about half an hour making a song in Ableton,\r\n                    I threw it on an audio source and set it to play on awake\r\n                    and loop, and there was my game music. In the future I'd\r\n                    really like to implement side-chain compression on the music\r\n                    so that the volume ducks when the player shoots or something\r\n                    blows up to make it punchier, but it seems like audio mixing\r\n                    isn't supported well in WebGL and it's really important for\r\n                    me to be able to just send people a link to play this in\r\n                    their browser.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Environmentalism</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    To make the game world feel a little more alive, I added two\r\n                    larger dolly tracks outside the play area and brought in\r\n                    more ships I made in Blender: a small fighter craft which\r\n                    will be an enemy in future, and a massive capital ship. It\r\n                    adds some much-needed depth to the scene:\r\n                </p>\r\n                <StaticImage\r\n                    layout=\"constrained\"\r\n                    width=\"600\"\r\n                    alt=\"lots of spaceships flying around with a big one in the distance\"\r\n                    src=\"https://github.com/maxwellsquared/minimal-portfolio/blob/main/img/Gameplay-4.png?raw=true\"\r\n                />\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The fighters operate in small swarms, and I used the\r\n                    transform.LookAt function to rotate them at a target\r\n                    slightly ahead of them on the track, which makes them swoop\r\n                    around elegantly and hides the fact that they're on rails.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Later, I started adding large cuboid objects intruding into\r\n                    the player's path to serve as wrecked buildings and (in part\r\n                    of the level) a city the player has to fly through. The\r\n                    dolly track system made it easy to throw obstacles into the\r\n                    player's path to navigate around, and I just tagged them\r\n                    with \"ground\" so they automatically make the player crash if\r\n                    they run into them. Copy-pasting them and randomly adjusting\r\n                    the height of the cuboid objects gave me a pretty good\r\n                    little city, and I sunk a few of them just enough that the\r\n                    player can skim them as they fly through. I threw some enemy\r\n                    ships on a loop around the city as well, and once I get some\r\n                    textures and effects going (fires? plumes of black smoke?\r\n                    screams?) it should be pretty exciting.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h2>Deployment</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I decided to build the game to WebGL, which is very handy\r\n                    for getting it onto somewhere like itch.io. Being able to\r\n                    play the game with a click of a button is a huge time saver,\r\n                    and it's also a lot more convenient for people to try out.\r\n                    Unity made it easy to add a splash screen.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Next Steps</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    My next step is to add a bomb for players which moves along\r\n                    an arc-shaped path and detonates when it hits something. As\r\n                    you can tell from the screenshots, I'm also going to need to\r\n                    figure out how much post-processing I can get away with\r\n                    before it starts looking like an Xbox 360 game.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </section>\r\n        </Layout>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const Head = () => <title>Building a Game</title>;\r\n\r\nexport default Game;\r\n"],"names":["Head","pageTitle","href","S","layout","width","alt","src"],"sourceRoot":""}
